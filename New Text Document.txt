	- Diffuser section heavily off "https://github.com/flight-test-engineering/Gas-Turbine-Propulsion/blob/main/turbojet/episd_6_combustor.ipynb"
	- Combustor section made before finding above resource. Just an fyi to self, they assume instantaneous mixing and ignition, mine aims to task into account 
		mass flows of fuel and air and residence/ mixing time which is why their code is different

	- Converting to python for better cantera documentation
	- Thus still need to add/ convert compressor and turbine functions
	- Single flow combustor working, way too high and unrealistic volume (2ft^3 before diffuser) needed for a residence time for ignition/ burn\

	To Do:
	- re-graph needed volume with single flow function now that diffuser function slows down mass flow into combustion chamber
	- Working on developing recirculation model and small air flow percentage next to fuel injectors
